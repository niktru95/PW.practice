## Environment Variables Setup

This project uses environment variables for configuration. To set up your environment:

1. Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project
2. Add the following variables:

   ```env
   QASE_API_TOKEN=your_api_token_here
   ```

Replace `your_api_token_here` with your actual Qase API token.

**Note**: The `.env` file is already included in `.gitignore` and should not be committed to version control. For reference, you can use the `.env.example` file as a template.
